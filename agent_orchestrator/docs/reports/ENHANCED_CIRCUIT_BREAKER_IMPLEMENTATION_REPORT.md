## Enhanced Features

### 1. PyBreaker Integration

```python
# Service-specific circuit breaker with pybreaker
circuit_breaker = pybreaker.CircuitBreaker(
    fail_max=config.fail_max,
    recovery_timeout=config.recovery_timeout,
    expected_exception=config.expected_exception,
    name=config.name
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Industry-standard circuit breaker implementation
- Proven reliability and performance
- Advanced state management
- Event listener support for monitoring

### 2. Service-Specific Configurations

Each downstream service has tailored circuit breaker settings:

- **RAG Service**: High priority, more tolerant (fail_max=5, timeout=30s)
- **Rule Generation Service**: Medium priority, sensitive (fail_max=3, timeout=20s)
- **Notifier Service**: High priority, quick recovery (fail_max=4, timeout=15s)
- **VMS Service**: Lower priority, very tolerant (fail_max=6, timeout=25s)
- **Prediction Service**: Medium priority, standard settings (fail_max=4, timeout=20s)

### 3. Intelligent Fallback Responses

Service-specific fallback responses ensure graceful degradation:

**RAG Service Fallback:**
```json
{
  "linked_explanation": "RAG service temporarily unavailable. Using cached response.",
  "retrieved_context": [],
  "confidence_score": 0.0,
  "fallback_reason": "Service unavailable due to circuit breaker protection"
}
```

**Rule Generation Service Fallback:**
```json
{
  "rules_triggered": [],
  "severity": "medium",
  "confidence": 0.5,
  "explanation": "Rule generation service unavailable. Using default assessment.",
  "fallback_reason": "Service unavailable due to circuit breaker protection"
}
```

**Notifier Service Fallback:**
```json
{
  "notification_queued": true,
  "status": "queued_for_retry",
  "message": "Notification service unavailable. Notification queued for retry.",
  "retry_scheduled": true
}
```

### 4. Redis State Persistence

Circuit breaker states are persisted to Redis for:
- State recovery across service restarts
- Cross-instance state sharing
- Historical state tracking
- Debugging and monitoring

```python
state_data = {
    'service_name': service_name,
    'state': state,
    'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
    'fail_counter': circuit_breaker.fail_counter
}
await redis_client.hset(f"circuit_breaker_state:{service_name}", mapping=state_data)
```

### 5. Comprehensive Metrics Collection

Enhanced Prometheus metrics for circuit breaker monitoring:

- `enhanced_circuit_breaker_state`: Current state (0=closed, 1=open, 2=half_open)
- `enhanced_circuit_breaker_requests_total`: Total requests by status
- `enhanced_circuit_breaker_failures_total`: Total failures by error type
- `enhanced_circuit_breaker_fallbacks_total`: Total fallback responses
- `enhanced_circuit_breaker_response_time_seconds`: Response time histogram

### 6. Health Monitoring and Administrative Controls

**Health Endpoint** (`GET /api/v1/circuit-breakers/health`):
```json
{
  "services": {
    "rag_service": {
      "service_name": "rag_service",
      "service_type": "rag_service",
      "circuit_breaker_state": "closed",
      "fail_counter": 0,
      "configuration": {
        "fail_max": 5,
        "recovery_timeout": 60,
        "timeout": 30.0,
        "fallback_enabled": true,
        "priority": 1
      }
    }
  },
  "total_services": 5,
  "timestamp": "2025-06-14T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Administrative Control** (`POST /api/v1/circuit-breakers/{service_name}/force-state`):
- Force circuit breaker to specific state for testing/maintenance
- Supports 'open', 'closed', 'half-open' states
- Includes proper authorization and validation

## Implementation Details

### Circuit Breaker State Transitions

1. **CLOSED → OPEN**: After `fail_max` consecutive failures
2. **OPEN → HALF_OPEN**: After `recovery_timeout` seconds
3. **HALF_OPEN → CLOSED**: After successful test requests
4. **HALF_OPEN → OPEN**: If test requests fail

### Enhanced Orchestration Flow

1. **RAG Service Call**: Circuit breaker protected with intelligent fallback
2. **Rule Generation Service Call**: Uses RAG context if available, fallback if not
3. **Notifier Service Call**: Queues for retry if circuit breaker triggers fallback
4. **Status Aggregation**: Comprehensive status reporting with circuit breaker health

### Error Handling Strategy

- **Immediate Fallback**: When circuit breaker is OPEN
- **Timeout Protection**: Requests timeout based on service configuration
- **Retry Logic**: Built into circuit breaker for transient failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Service-specific fallback responses
- **Queue Management**: Failed notifications queued for background retry

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage

1. **Unit Tests**: 
   - Service registration and configuration
   - Circuit breaker state transitions
   - Fallback response generation
   - Metrics collection

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Full orchestration scenarios
   - Circuit breaker protection in action
   - Health monitoring functionality
   - Administrative controls

3. **Load Tests**:
   - Concurrent service calls
   - Circuit breaker behavior under load
   - Recovery cycle testing

### Key Test Scenarios

```python
# Test circuit breaker opens after failures
async def test_circuit_breaker_opens_on_failures():
    for _ in range(fail_max + 1):
        await call_service_with_failure()
    
    # Circuit should now be open
    assert circuit_breaker_state == 'open'
    assert result['fallback_used'] is True

# Test recovery cycle
async def test_circuit_breaker_recovery_cycle():
    # Trigger failures -> open circuit
    # Wait for recovery timeout -> half-open
    # Successful calls -> closed circuit
    assert final_state == 'closed'
```

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Circuit Breaker Settings
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RAG_FAIL_MAX=5
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RAG_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT=60
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_NOTIFIER_FAIL_MAX=4
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_NOTIFIER_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT=30

# Redis Configuration for State Persistence
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
REDIS_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TTL=3600
```

### Service Configuration

```python
ServiceConfig(
    name="service_name",
    service_type=ServiceType.RAG_SERVICE,
    fail_max=5,                    # Failures before opening
    recovery_timeout=60,           # Seconds before half-open
    timeout=30.0,                  # Request timeout
    fallback_enabled=True,         # Enable fallback responses
    priority=1                     # Service priority (1-3)
)
```
