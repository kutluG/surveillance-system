"""
Test Coverage Completion Script

This script addresses the request to add comprehensive test coverage for:
1. Edge cases (very large result sets, unusual timestamp formats)
2. Performance under load  
3. Cache behavior
4. Resilience during service degradation

Status: These test suites have already been implemented and are available:
- test_comprehensive_edge_cases.py (edge cases and resilience)
- test_performance_benchmarks.py (performance under load)
- test_advanced_caching.py (cache behavior)
- test_query_event_validation.py (timestamp validation)

However, there are some code issues to fix before running the full test suite.
