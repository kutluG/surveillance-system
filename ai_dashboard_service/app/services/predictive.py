Predictive Analytics Engine Service

This module provides advanced predictive analytics capabilities for surveillance
systems, including security threat forecasting, equipment failure prediction,
traffic pattern analysis, and occupancy level prediction. It uses machine learning
algorithms and statistical models to provide actionable insights.

The service integrates multiple prediction models and provides real-time forecasting
capabilities with confidence scores and timeline projections. It supports various
prediction types and can be extended with additional ML models.

Key Features:
- Security threat prediction using pattern analysis
- Equipment failure forecasting based on performance metrics
- Traffic and occupancy pattern prediction
- Model caching and performance optimization
- Confidence scoring and risk assessment
- Integration with LLM services for enhanced insights

Classes:
    PredictiveEngine: Main prediction engine with multiple forecasting models
    
Dependencies:
    - NumPy: For numerical computations and statistical analysis
    - LLMService: For AI-powered prediction enhancement (TODO: Refactor to DI)
    - JSON: For data serialization and model persistence
    - Logging: For error tracking and performance monitoring
