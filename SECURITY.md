## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Surveillance System seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to security@yourcompany.com with the following information:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days.
- **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress toward a fix.
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical security issues within 30 days.

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow a responsible disclosure process:

1. We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
2. We will keep you informed throughout the process
3. We will credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
4. We will coordinate the timing of the public disclosure

## Security Best Practices

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive information like API keys to version control
2. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS/TLS for all external communications
3. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. **Database Security**: Use strong passwords and connection encryption
5. **Container Security**: Regularly update base images and scan for vulnerabilities
6. **Monitoring**: Enable security monitoring and alerting

### For Development

1. **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies and scan for known vulnerabilities
2. **Code Review**: All code changes should be reviewed by at least one other developer
3. **Testing**: Include security testing in your CI/CD pipeline
4. **Secrets Management**: Use proper secrets management tools
5. **Access Control**: Implement least privilege access principles

### Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All default passwords changed
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates properly configured
- [ ] Environment variables configured (no secrets in code)
- [ ] Database access restricted
- [ ] Network access properly configured (firewalls, security groups)
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting enabled
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested
- [ ] Security scanning completed
- [ ] Access logs enabled
- [ ] Incident response plan in place

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure API access with JSON Web Tokens
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are protected against abuse
- **CORS Configuration**: Cross-origin requests are properly configured
- **Secure Headers**: Security headers are set by default
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit

### Security Dependencies

The system includes several security-focused dependencies:

- `passlib[bcrypt]` for password hashing
- `python-jose[cryptography]` for JWT handling
- `cryptography` for encryption operations
- Regular security updates through dependabot

### Security Monitoring

- **Health Checks**: Regular monitoring of all services
- **Log Analysis**: Centralized logging for security event analysis
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance and security metrics via Prometheus
- **Alerting**: Real-time alerts for security incidents

## Known Security Considerations

### Camera Access

- **Physical Security**: Ensure cameras are physically secured
- **Network Security**: Use encrypted RTSP streams when possible
- **Access Control**: Limit network access to camera feeds

### Data Privacy

- **Video Storage**: Consider data retention policies for video clips
- **Personal Data**: Ensure compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- **Access Logging**: Log all access to sensitive data

### API Security

- **Authentication**: All API endpoints require proper authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control implemented
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized

## Vulnerability Disclosure

We maintain a responsible disclosure policy and will:

- Acknowledge security reports within 48 hours
- Provide regular updates on investigation progress
- Work to resolve issues within 30 days for critical vulnerabilities
- Credit security researchers (unless anonymity is preferred)
- Coordinate public disclosure timing

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Email**: security@yourcompany.com
- **Emergency**: For critical security issues requiring immediate attention
- **GitHub**: Use private vulnerability reporting if available
